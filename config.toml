Documentation, testing and code standards are just as important as code quality.\n\nI first got interested in development at a young age when I saw my dad building basic websites with Microsoft FrontPage. Since then, I have been constantly learning new things myself and keeping on top of current web trends.\n\nWhen I'm not developing, I can usually be found on my aggressive skates either grinding on rails or flying through the air off ramps. I enjoy binge watching series' on Netflix, playing the occasional computer game, renovating the house or tinkering electronics. I have a keen interest in electrical engineering and have completed a few related projects, such as:\n\n - Creating my own 60% keyboard\n - Designing and manufacturing a small batch run of custom GameBoy Cartridges\n - Creating small PCB's which allow you to have USB-C charging on the GameBoy Advance SP and a similar product for the Nintendo DS Lite."
