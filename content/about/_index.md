Hello.

My name is James. I'm currently the head of development at [MyPTHub](https://www.mypthub.net). I'm a full stack developer but have a preference for back-end development.

I'm a strong believer in sticking to code standards, documenting code, testing code and producing quality code.

The tech i use on a day to day basis is:

- PHP 7 / PHP 7.2
- Laravel 5.4 / Laravel 5.7
- AngularJS
- VueJS
- Terraform
- Ionic / Cordova
