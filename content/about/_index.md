Hello.

My name is James. I'm currently the head of development at [MyPTHub](https://www.mypthub.net).

I'm a full stack developer with experience in multiple languages.

I'm a strong believe in producing high quality, readable code. Documentation, testing and code standards are just as important as code quality.

### Backend 

- PHP 7 / PHP 7.3
- Laravel 5.4 / Laravel 5.8

### Frontend

- Vue
- React
- Redux
- AngularJS

### Mobile
